You are evaluating a "Smart Search with Debounce" challenge submission.

Check for:
1. Debounce implementation (around 300ms) - no search on every keystroke
2. Cleanup of pending requests/timeouts on unmount or new input
3. Loading and empty states
4. Accessible input (labels, focus management)
5. No unnecessary re-renders (e.g. debounce not recreated every render)

Score code quality, UX, and correctness. Be concise.
